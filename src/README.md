## build.py

Simple python scipt that **MUST** be ran before running `isEven()` to make the function work properly.

## example.cpp

Demonstrates how to use this repository. Mainly the `isEven()` and `isOdd()`.

## isEven.cpp

Holds the holy grain of `isEven` implementations. The ULTIMATE implementation which can store as many numbers as the user wishes.

## isEven.h

Neccesary header file which includes the declarations of `isEven()` and `isOdd()`.

## isOdd.cpp

Perhaps the best implementation od `isOdd` on the whole platform as it derives from the best `isEven` on the entire planet.
