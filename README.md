# The Ultimate isEven!

Have you ever wondered if a number is even or odd? Well those times are over! With this implementation of `isEven()` you can once and for all determine if a number is even! And it doesn't end there! I also included `isOdd()` so you can be 100% sure when number is odd!

# Installation <a name="Installation"></a>

1. Clone this repository (if you haven't done so already)
```
git https://github.com/Roiqk7/isEven
```
2. Default `isEven.cpp` supports integers from 1 to 600420 (because github doesn't allow for larger files). If thats fine for you, you can stop there. Else if you want more integers, follow this tutorial.
3. Open your terminal
4. Go into the repo directory
5. Run `python3 build.py`
6. Everything is set and done!
